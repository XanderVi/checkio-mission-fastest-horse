<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    We have some statistics about horse races (time for each horse in each race).<br>
    You have to find the number of the horse which has the most wins.<br>
    For example: if the results are [[“1:13”, “1:26”, “1:11”], [“1:10”, “1:18”, “1:14”], [“1:20”, “1:23”, “1:15”]] than the 3rd horse is the fastest, because she has 2 wins at 3 races.<br>
    Every element in the list - is a string in format m:ss, for example "1:05" or "2:22". 1:00 <= time <= 5:00
</p>

</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Racing time as array of arrays.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Number of the fastest horse, which has the most wins (Important: in this task the numbers of horses are started from "1", not from "0") 
</p>


<!-- Put some usage examples -->
<div class="for_info_only">

<strong>Example:</strong>

{% if interpreter.slug == "js-node" %}

<!-- Here you can explain how it can be used in development and what is usage of this. -->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    For data analysis and statistics (finding elements which we want in the huge amount of data).
</p>

<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p><strong>Precondition</strong>:<br>
    2 <= horses <= 10<br>
    1 <= races <= 10<br>
    1:00 <= time <= 5:00<br>
    There is only 1 fastest horse in each test
